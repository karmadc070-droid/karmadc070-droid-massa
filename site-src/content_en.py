Providers remit the 10% platform commission within 3 days of the service date."),

Where a dispute arises, the company will check records, establish facts and apply penalties as needed. The company is not liable for loss arising from causes beyond its control, such as natural disaster or network failure."),

At most one row per device per day; no name, email or IP address is stored alongside it."),
